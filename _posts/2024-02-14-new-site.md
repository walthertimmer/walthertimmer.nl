Time to simple refurbish my site. Make it even more simple thanks to a minimal design Jekyll template. I use Duo for this (https://chibicode.github.io/duo/).

The site itself is hosted on Github pages. No configuring servers, it just works. 

Locally I can develop using WSL2 and see the results on localhost before pushing changes to Github. 

Jekyll makes it possible to have a easy lightweight CRM/blogging system which will produce simple flat webfiles which you can host using a CDN. And for most usecases a simple website will be free to host on CDNs like that from Github Pages or DigitalOcean. Or simply cents a month on AWS. 

## Lessons learned
- Don't try to run Jekyll from the Windows subsystem but rather from its own filesystem otherwise it will be horrible slow to build (think multiple minutes). Same case for installation of various Ruby Gem's.
