Time to simple refurbish my site. Make it even more simple thanks to a minimal design Jekyll template. I use Duo for this (https://chibicode.github.io/duo/).

The site itself is hosted on Github pages. No configuring servers, it just works. 

Locally I can develop using WSL2 and see the results on localhost before pushing changes to Github.
