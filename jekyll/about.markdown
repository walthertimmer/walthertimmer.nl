I am Walther Timmer, an economics graduate from Utrecht University. On this website you can find information about who I am, what I do, and how you can contact me.

My professional interests are improving efficiency within business by doing the same or more with less resources, may that be hardware capacity or human resources. And besides that making it possible to steer a companyâ€™s strategy on data, not just gut feelings. Luckily for me both of these can be combined and accomplished in the world of business intelligence and â€˜big dataâ€™.

Additionally I personally think that it is important that every individual is free to pursue his or her own goals and truly be themselves. This way everybody can be happy and achieve whatever they find important. Because of this I have fulfilled various positions at the local and regional community of the Dutch Liberal Party (VVD).

Currently I am employed as a business intelligence / data-warehouse specialist at Hot ITem. This is a small business intelligence consultancy club which focuses on delivering tool independent IT advisory and consultancy services aimed at truly improving business value at the customers project or department. At this job I can use my analytical skills and curiosity to master the latest developments in BI and big data. See my LinkedIn page for more information about the tooling I have worked with and the projects I have contributed to.

In my free time I really enjoy doing sports and visiting various concerts. I like to alternate these activities with a lot of food ðŸ™‚
