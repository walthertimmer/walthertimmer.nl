## About Walther Timmer

![Walther](/static/images/profile-modified.png)

I'm a data engineer at Hot ITem, a boutique data consulting firm based in Amsterdam. I work on data projects in the cloud, mostly Azure, and do both the cloud engineering part of things as the data engineering part. 

I like to keep this site minimal and like to thank Jekyll and Github for enabling this desire.
