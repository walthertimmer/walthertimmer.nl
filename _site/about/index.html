<p>I am a data engineer that loves to learn! Luckily within the field of data engineering / business intelligence I get to work with engineers as well as â€˜businessâ€™ so there are a lot of learning possibilities for me.</p>

<p>My professional interests are scripting, infrastructure as code, solution architecture and project management. I really like it when I can combine these interests within my projects and as a team we can deliver valuable insights into the performance of the customerâ€™s company. After all, business intelligence is only worthwhile if we can truly help the business perform better based on data.</p>

<p>Furthermore I like politics and have been political active since I was 18 for either the local or regional community of the Dutch Liberal Party (VVD). I think that we all have a responsibility to improve our society and make sure that as many people as possible are accepted for who they are. Additionally everybody should have access to resources to improve themselves and should be able to reap the rewards of their self-improvement.</p>

<p>In my free time I really enjoy doing sports and visiting various concerts. I like to alternate these activities with a lot of food ðŸ™‚</p>
